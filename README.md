# matchascan

In the 1970s, when my dad graduated from college, he tried to make video games. This is a recreation of one of them. 
I first recreated the game in 2001 in VisualBasic using an old Match-A-Scan product manual I found in my dad's basement.
In 2021, I wrote this from scratch and from memory, since I could no longer find the manual nor the VisualBasic code.
